# INTRODUCTION
Chi Hack Night (http://chihacknight.org/) is a group of thousands of designers, academic researchers, data journalists, activists, policy wonks, web developers and curious citizens who strive to make our city more just, equitable, transparent and delightful to live in through data, design and technology. 

We volunteer every week to build tools to support and serve the public good. Open government data makes it possible for us to do this work. 

# PLEDGE
Releasing open data is essential for government to be transparent and accountable to its constituents. It provides the public with information they need and are legally entitled to without having to request individual records. Open data is a proactive way to share data with citizens, reporters, and other government agencies.

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s office has data on a wide variety of cases that are critical for the public to know. I recognize that providing access to public data creates a transparent and accountable government and that timely, public data from the State’s Attorney’s office is critical to the judicial process.

If I am elected I will adopt and provide funding for an open data policy that includes a presumption of openness [1][2] and release all of my office’s data  – including data provided from contractors – to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy, confidentiality, security, or other restrictions. It should be opened according to the eight principles of open government data [3].
